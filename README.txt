To get our application working you'll need to compile the java file into a .jar with the manifest.txt.

We also included the .mwb file for the MySQLWorkbench in the event that would be easier to see all of the stored procedures and table creation calls. 

Check the User Manual for installation instructions. 

ENJOY!
