This is the GitHub Repository for our COP4710 - Database Management Systems. Our project was to create a site that the UCF EECS Faculty would be able to use to place orders for supplies. This was our first time implementing most of these technologies. That being said no promises what we did was clever or efficient in all instances.  

Please enjoy!

To get our application working you'll need to compile the java file into a .jar with the manifest.txt.

We also included the .mwb file for the MySQLWorkbench in the event that would be easier to see all of the stored procedures and table creation calls. 

Check the User Manual for installation instructions. 

ENJOY!
